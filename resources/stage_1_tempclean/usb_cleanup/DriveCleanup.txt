Freeware by Uwe Sieber (c) 2007-2016

Works under Windows XP and higher only. Under x64 edtitions of Windows
only the x64 version works.


Removes from the device tree non present 
- USB hubs
- USB mass storage devices 
- USB Disk devices
- USB CDROM devices
- USB Floppy devices
- USB Storage Volumes
- USB WPD devices (Vista, Win7, Win8 and higher only)

and their registry items under

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\UsbFlags
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceClasses
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2\CPC\Volume

Usage:

DriveCleanup [-t] [-n] [-u] [-d] [-c] [-f] [-v] [-r]

no params:  cleanup all
-t          test mode
-n          no wait for keypress when finished if started standalone
-u          only USB mass storage devices 
-d          only USB Disk devices
-c          only USB CDROM devices
-f          only USB Floppy devices
-v          only USB Storage Volume devices
-r          only registry items of USB volumes
-w          only USB WPD devices

Called with admin previleges and without a parameter it removes all types of devices
listed above and cleans the registry.
Without admin previleges it switches to test mode and shows the item it would remove.


Samples:

DriveCleanup -t
test mode, lists devices and registry items to remove

DriveCleanup
removes non present devices related to drives and their registry items

DriveCleanup -v -d
removes non present USB Storage Volumes and USB Disks


Administrator previleges are required for cleanup.


DriveCleanup isn't stricly limited to drives, USB hubs and the Enum\NextParentID.xxxxx.n
values may be not drive related.
Deleteing automatically any type of non-present device seems to be too dangerous, therefore
I've made a GUI tool for this, so it's up to the user not to delete something important...

DriveCleanup calls Windows device manangement functions for deleting devices entries. If it shows OK
then Windows responded that this succeeded. When finished DriveCleanup checks all again and should
find zero devices if it showed OK for all before. Sometimes Windows says OK but in fact the device
is still present.


Since Vista Administrators have no more write access to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum
and even being the owner they have no right to change the permissions. Therefore deleting unreferenced
NextParentID.xxxxx.n items needs more than admin previleges. To get these, DriveCleanup starts itself in
the SYSTEM context to change Enum's security descriptor, performs the cleanup and restores the security
descriptor. Maybe this alerts security software.

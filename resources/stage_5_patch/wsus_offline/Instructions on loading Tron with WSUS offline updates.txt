Tron can execute bundled offline updates created with the WSUS Offline tool, instead of using the online update mechanism.

If Tron detects this specific path during Stage 5:

    stage_5_patch\wsus_offline\client\Update.cmd
	
it will skip online updates and use the bundled updates instead, unless you use the -swo command-line switch, which will force it to skip WSUS Offline regardless whether it's present or not.

You can get WSUS Offline here:     http://download.wsusoffline.net/


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download WSUS Offline
2. Run it and have it download the applicable updates you want
3. Copy the "client" folder (usually in \wsusoffline\client) to \tron\resources\stage_5_patch\wsus_offline
4. Make sure that "Update.cmd" is present in this path: \tron\resources\stage_5_patch\wsus_offline\client\Update.cmd
5. Run Tron, it should automatically detect and use the offline updates

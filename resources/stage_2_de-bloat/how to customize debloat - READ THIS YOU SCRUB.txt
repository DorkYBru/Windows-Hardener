There are five files in these sub-directories that determine what Tron targets for bloatware removal:

1. \oem\programs_to_target_by_name.txt
2. \oem\programs_to_target_by_GUID.txt
3. \oem\toolbars_BHOs_to_target_by_GUID.txt
4. \metro\metro_3rd_party_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1
5. \metro\metro_Microsoft_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1

You can customize any of these files to tweak what Tron targets for removal.


#  \oem\programs_to_target_by_name.txt

 Insert program NAMES, one per line, into the file. Tron will try to uninstall any program
 whose name matches one of the names in this file. Don't put any special characters around
 the name (quotes, commas, etc). Spaces are fine. Tron uses WMI queries inside a batch file,
 so the wildcard character is double-percent (%%).

Example list:
    Cyberlink%%
    Dell Getting Started Guide%%
    Dell Video%%
    %%Toolbar%%

So in this example,  Dell%%  would catch and attempt to remove both "Dell Getting Started Guide" AND "Dell Video."



#  \oem\programs_to_target_by_GUID.txt

 List specific GUIDs to target, one per line. This file is commented like batch but technically plain text.



#  \oem\toolbars_BHOs_to_target_by_GUID.txt

 List specific GUIDs to target, one per line. This file is commented like batch but technically plain text.
 It's separate from programs_to_target_by_GUID.txt just for organization; Tron executes both files
 the same way.



#  \metro\metro_3rd_party_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1

 This is a Powershell script listing pre-loaded 3rd-party "Modern" apps. Add any 3rd-party "Modern"
 apps you want to remove to this list. This file may also be executed directly from an administrator-privileged
 PowerShell session.



#  \metro\metro_Microsoft_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1

 This is a Powershell script listing pre-loaded Microsoft "Modern" apps. Customize this list to tweak
 which official Microsoft "modern" apps get removed. This file may also be executed directly from an administrator-privileged
 PowerShell session.



 !! NOTE !!

Many programs do not register with WMI and so can't be targeted with the by_GUID scripts.
For those programs, you'll just have to remove them manually. This stage is just a "best-effort"
attempt to automate some of the tedium.

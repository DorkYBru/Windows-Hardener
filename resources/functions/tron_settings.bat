:: Purpose:       Tron's settings script, called when it launches. Customize this file to change how Tron behaves. 
::                Sub-stage scripts also call this file if they're launched directly.
:: Requirements:  n/a

:: Version:       1.0.5 - Remove references to Adobe Flash
::                1.0.4 + Add PRESERVE_MALWAREBYTES (-rmb) switch to have Tron automatically remove Malwarebytes at the end of the run
::                      + Add SKIP_COOKIE_CLEANUP (-scc) switch to have Tron preserve ALL cookies. Thanks to tbr:sebastian
::                1.0.3 + Add SKIP_ONEDRIVE_REMOVAL (-sor) switch. Thanks to github:ptrkhh
::                1.0.2 - Remove references to Java
::                1.0.1 + Add AUTORUN_IN_SAFE_MODE (-asm) switch and associated variable. Combine this with -a to automatically reboot to Safe Mode prior to running (legacy behavior)
::                1.0.0 . Initial write; forked out of v9.9.0 of tron.bat

:::::::::::::::
:: VARIABLES ::
:::::::::::::::
:: Rules for variables:
::  * NO quotes!                    (bad:  "c:\directory\path"       )
::  * NO trailing slashes on paths! (bad:   c:\directory\            )
::  * Spaces are okay               (okay:  c:\my folder\with spaces )
::  * Network paths are okay        (okay:  \\server\share name      )

:: LOGPATH is the parent directory for all of Tron's output (logs, backups, etc). Tweak the paths below to your liking if you want to change it
:: If you want a separate directory generated per Tron run (for example if doing multiple runs for testing), use something like this:
::   set LOGPATH=%SystemDrive%\logs\tron\%COMPUTERNAME%_%DTS%
set LOGPATH=%SystemDrive%\logs\tron

:: Master log file. To differentiate logfiles if you're doing multiple runs, you can do something like:
::  set LOGFILE=tron_%COMPUTERNAME%_%DTS%.log
set LOGFILE=tron.log

:: Where Tron should save files that the various virus scanners put in quarantine. Currently unused (created, but nothing is stored here)
set QUARANTINE_PATH=%LOGPATH%\quarantine

:: Registry, Event Logs, and power scheme backups are all saved here
set BACKUPS=%LOGPATH%\backups

:: Where to save raw unprocessed logs from the various sub-tools
set RAW_LOGS=%LOGPATH%\raw_logs

:: Where to save the summary logs (created from the raw logs)
set SUMMARY_LOGS=%LOGPATH%\summary_logs


:::::::::::::::::::::
:: SCRIPT DEFAULTS ::
:::::::::::::::::::::
:: ! These are Tron's defaults. All settings here are overridden if their respective command-line switch is used
::   If you use a CLI switch and Tron encounters a reboot, the CLI switch will be honored when the script resumes
:: AUTORUN                (-a)   = Automatic execution (no welcome screen or prompts), implies -e
:: AUTORUN_IN_SAFE_MODE   (-asm) = Automatic execution (no welcome screen or prompts), implies -e, autoboots to Safe Mode
:: DRY_RUN                (-d)   = Run through script but skip all actual actions (test mode)

:: SKIP_ANTIVIRUS_SCANS   (-sa)  = Skip ALL antivirus scans (KVRT, MBAM, SAV). Use per-scanner switches to individually toggle usage
:: SKIP_APP_PATCHES       (-sap) = Set to yes to skip application patches (don't patch 7-Zip)
:: SKIP_COOKIE_CLEANUP    (-scc) = Set to yes to preserve ALL cookies (not recommended, Tron auto-preserves most common login cookies)

:: SKIP_DEFRAG            (-sd)  = Set to yes to override the SSD detection check and force Tron to always skip defrag regardless of the drive type
